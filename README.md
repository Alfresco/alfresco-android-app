# Welcome to the Alfresco Android Application

## What Is Alfresco Mobile?

Alfresco Mobile connects to Alfresco in the cloud and Alfresco on premise servers (4.0 and above) to provide safe access to your corporate documents on the go. <br/>
Alfresco Mobile connects to your Alfresco repository using your Alfresco log-in credentials (over HTTP or HTTPS), and manages user access based on their permissions. <br/>
Alfresco Mobile is based on top of our Alfresco Android SDK. More information on Alfresco Android SDK can be found on our [developer portal](http://developer.alfresco.com/mobile).
